The Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO) enables institutions as well as researchers
to plan and carry out their management of research data. RDMO can assemble all relevant planning information
and data management tasks across the whole life cycle of the research data.

RDMO is ready for application in smaller or bigger projects. In two project phases, the tool was continuously developed by the project partners AIP, FHP, and KIT Library in close cooperation with users. The tool was extended by enhancing its implementation of roles and interfaces to institutional infrastructure,
e.g. repositories, ticketing systems, and the infrastructure for authentication and autorization.
Tutorials, documentation and other material were creazted for dissemination, and workshops for users and developers were organized.

On these pages, we provide information about the [RDMO Consortium]({{site.baseurl}}/en/rdmo_arge), the [software]({{site.baseurl}}/en/software) and its [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/documentation), [news]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/news) and [cooperations]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/cooperations). RDMO has been built by the [RDMO-project]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/project), and its [workpackages]({{ site.baseurl }}/en/workpackages). Development of RDMO is continued by the RDMO-Consortium.
