# 3rd Community-Meeting: Foundation Meeting as Open Source Projekt

Organised by the RDMO project

- Date: 24.02.2020
- Location: Leibniz Institute for Astrophysics Potsdam (AIP), Lecture Hall
- An der Sternwarte 16, 14482 Potsdam / Babelsberg

The focus of the user meeting is the foundation of the RDMO community as an open source project. As a result of the last user meeting, further discussions and clarifications, the [RDMO Manifesto](https://rdmorganiser.github.io/docs/RDMO-Manifest-122019.pdf) has been created, which sets the framework for the continuation.

The [registration for the meeting](https://meetings.aip.de/rdmo/meetings/RDMO-FOS/registration/) is open, as already announced in the monthly mail.

A programme for the meeting will be published here in early January. Suggestions are welcome.

We look forward to your participation.
